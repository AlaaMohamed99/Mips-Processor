# Mips-Processor
implement of a functional Mips Processor in Verilog
processor must be able to take as input a text file with binary instructions
[Which are assembly instructions converted to their binary form, either R
format, I format, or J format]. The processor will then read those instructions into its
instruction memory and start performing them all just as a true processor will
do, updating memory and register file contents. the processorsupport the
following instructions :
[ add - sw - lw - sll - and - or - beq - J - JAL - JR - addi - ori - slt].
Also there is a gui and assembler
